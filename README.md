Tello EDU Drone Experiments 🛸

This repository contains my practical work and experiments with the DJI Tello EDU drone using Python.
The project reflects my learning process in computer vision, drone control, and real-time tracking, with a main focus on face tracking.

📌 Project Overview

The repository includes multiple scripts exploring different aspects of controlling the Tello drone, such as:

Basic drone movement and flight control

Camera stream handling

Computer vision experiments using OpenCV

Real-time face detection and tracking

All files were developed as part of hands-on experimentation and learning, rather than as a single monolithic application.

⭐ Main Feature — Face Tracking

The core and most important file in this repository is:

face_tranking.py


This script implements real-time face tracking, where the drone:

Detects a human face from the live camera feed

Adjusts its position automatically to keep the face centered

Uses computer vision techniques for detection and control logic

This file represents the final and most complete result of the work in this repository.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

DJI Tello EDU SDK

OpenCV

NumPy

Real-time video streaming and processing

📂 Repository Structure

Multiple .py files — individual experiments and learning steps

face_tranking.py — main face-tracking implementation

Supporting scripts for testing movement, camera feed, and controls

Some files may overlap in functionality or serve as intermediate prototypes created during development.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Practice working with drones and robotics

Learn computer vision in a real-time environment

Understand feedback-based control systems

Build a foundation for more advanced autonomous drone projects

🚀 Future Improvements

Possible next steps include:

Object tracking beyond faces

PID control for smoother movements

Obstacle avoidance

Code refactoring into a modular architecture

ROS / ROS2 integration
