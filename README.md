# Tello EDU Drone Experiments 🛸

This repository contains my practical work and experiments with the **DJI Tello EDU** drone using **Python**.  
It reflects my hands-on learning process in **drone control, computer vision, and real-time tracking**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository includes multiple Python scripts created while exploring different aspects of controlling the Tello drone, such as:

- Drone movement and flight commands
- Camera stream handling
- Computer vision with OpenCV
- Real-time object and face tracking

The codebase is experimental in nature and represents incremental learning rather than a single finalized application.

## ⭐ Main File — Face Tracking

The **main and most important file** in this repository is:


This script implements **real-time face tracking**, allowing the drone to:

- Detect a human face from the live video stream
- Automatically adjust its position
- Keep the detected face centered in the frame

This file represents the most complete and functional result of the work in this repository.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- DJI Tello EDU SDK
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Real-time video streaming

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Multiple `.py` files — individual experiments and prototypes
- `face_tranking.py` — main face-tracking implementation
- Supporting scripts for testing drone movement and camera feed

Some files may overlap in functionality as they were created during different stages of learning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice drone programming and control
- Learn computer vision in real-time systems
- Understand feedback-based motion control
- Build a foundation for autonomous drone projects

---

## 🚀 Possible Future Improvements

- PID control for smoother tracking
- Object tracking beyond faces
- Obstacle avoidance
- Code refactoring and modularization
- ROS / ROS2 integration
